## Dataset Description:

The YTS was developed to provide states with comprehensive data on both middle school and high school students regarding tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking cessation, school curriculum, minors' ability to purchase or otherwise obtain tobacco products, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco, and familiarity with pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media messages. The YTS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in middle schools (grades 6–8) and high schools (grades 9–12). The data for the STATE System were extracted from Youth Tobacco Surveys from participating states. Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, smokeless tobacco products prevalence and quit attempts.

## Dataset Content(s):
Each row within our dataset is a youth tobacco survey entry conducted according to the recorded year. The important columns we have focused on within this dataset are the year the YTS was conducted (YEAR), the state in which it was conducted(LocationDesc), the topic type being “tobacco usage” for all data entries(TopicType), the detailed description of that topic (TopicDesc), the source of our data (DataSource), the responses from the YTS (Response), the data value(Data_Value) and its data type (Data_Value_Type), which genders were focused per survey (Gender), what races were observed (Race), the age group(s) observed (Age), and the education level of the student(s) (Education).

## Two meaningful questions: 

1.  How does education level affect the levels at which survey respondents use tobacco over time?

2.  How does the number of people/density of people who frequently smoke change over time by state?
